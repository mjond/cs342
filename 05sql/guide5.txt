1. Basic SQL (Section 6.3) — Review basic SQL as needed, then write sample queries that:
	a. Use one or more tuple variables (Section 6.3.2).

	SELECT M.title
	FROM Movie as M, Performer as P
	WHERE M.title = 'Star Wars' AND P.id = 1;

	b. Use one or more of the set operations, e.g., UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT (Section 6.3.4).

	SELECT title
	FROM Movie
	UNION
	SELECT firstName, lastName
	FROM Performer;



2. Advanced SQL (Sections 7.1.1–7.1.5) — This will include more new material; write sample queries that:

	a. Select based on a NULL field value (Section 7.1.1).

	SELECT firstName
	FROM Performer
	WHERE lastName IS NULL;
	
	b. Implement a nested sub-query, using [NOT] EXISTS, IN, ANY or ALL (Sections 7.1.2–7.1.4).

	SELECT *
	FROM Performer
	WHERE id IN ( SELECT id
			      FROM Performers
			      WHERE id < 3) ;
	
	c. Implement a correlated sub-query (Section 7.1.3)
	
	SELECT id
	FROM Performer
	WHERE id IN ( SELECT id
			      FROM Performers
			      WHERE id < 3) ;
