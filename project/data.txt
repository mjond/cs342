CS342 project design

All the data was copied from www.nhl.com. On that website, I looked at specific teams such as the Canadiens, Maple Leafs or best players of all time. 
The data I copied was goals scored, assists, save percentages and the players' positions. 
I manually copied the data over into the tables using the INSERT command.

The normal form used in the table is 4NF. I chose this form because it works best for my database and it is the most strict.
