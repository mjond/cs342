My information system project will be a NHL fantasy hockey. It will contain players, teams, positions, games, scores and more.
The stakeholders will be people interested in learning statistics about a team or
people who want to make their own team and play other teams.
Administrators will also be a stakeholder in order to keep the database maintained and updated. 

Right now, the tables are: Team, Player, Game, and User. Referential integrity will be important to maintain with all the relations between tables. 
Allow users to log in and make comments and create a team. 
Entity integrity will be important as well. For example, a player could play multiple positions on a team. 
This domain is different than ones discussed in class.
