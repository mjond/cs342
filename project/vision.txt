My information system project will be a NHL fantasy hockey. It will contain players, teams, positions, games, scores, user accounts and statistics about the players.
Information about games will also be stored such as points scored, winner and user's comments on games. 
The stakeholders will be people interested in learning statistics about a team or people who want to make their own team and play other teams.
Administrators will also be a stakeholder in order to keep the database maintained and updated. 

Right now, the tables are: Team, UserAccount, Player, Goalie, UserTeam, Game and GameComment. Referential integrity will be important to maintain with all the relations between tables. 
Entity integrity will be important as well. For example, a player could play multiple positions on a team. 
This domain is different than ones discussed in class. Most tables are in 4NF.
