Exercise 13.1

a) em.persist() - this function creates a new entity, adds it to the context and future updates will be tracked
    store.put() - the put function is used to put a key-value pair into the store.

b) myHashTable.put() is similar to store.put() in that both put() commands bind a key and a value to the store or the hashtable.


Exercise 13.2

a) KVLite keys - kvLite keys point to a single value in a column
    relational database keys - relational keys point to an entire record that can be retrieved as one entity


Exercise 13.3

a) I'm not yet sure...

b) One might create an empty value if one does not know the value yet but still wants to create the column to be consistent with other records.
    Null values are also useful in NoSQL for many-to-many relationships.
