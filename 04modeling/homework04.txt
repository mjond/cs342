Exercise 14.31

Book(book_title, author_name, book_type, list_price, author_affil, publisher)

book_title -> publisher, book_type
book_type -> list_price
author_name -> author_affil

a)
This is 1NF form but not 2NF because no attributes are fully funcionally dependent on the key. 

b)
Here is the 2NF decomposition:
	book1(book_title, author_name)
	book2(book_title, publisher, book_type, list_price)
	book3(author_name, author_affil)
This eliminates partial dependency.

Here is the 3NF decomposition:
	book1(book_title, author_name)
	book2(book_title, publisher, book_type)
	book3(book_type, list_price)
	book4(author_name, author_affil)
This eliminates the dependency of list_price from the 2NF decomposition.

c)
Book(book_name, edition)
BookAuthor(book_name, edition, author)
BookYear(book_name, edition, year)
